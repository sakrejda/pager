Description: ggplot doesn't provide a facet_wrap-like facility to spread plots over multiple pages.  This package manipulates plot lists for certian plots and provides functions to style them.  It handles only very specific plots (time-series, points on time-series, bounds for both, x-continuous/y-factor with bounds, and maps)  because the goal is to support specific packages.
